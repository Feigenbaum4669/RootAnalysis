#NOTE: File htt.ini files contain paths to the data files. Please update it before running the code.
#Running the analysis requires three steps:
# 1) - making histograms with number of primary vertices in MC files used in analysis
#     Step 1) is expectedd to be run only once, when new data files are produced.
#     for this one has to set. Before this please remove old ROOT files:

rm -f RootAnalysis*


#  Weights step expects a file in current directory:
#  MyDataPileupHistogram.root - file with PU estimated in DATA, created using relevant on luminosity JSON.
#
#processName = Weights
#
# in htt.iti

./test htt.ini #this creates histograms with weights as a fnction of PU used in MC samples.


#  2) The main analysis. This step is expected to be run many times.
#  To run this step one has to set
#  Analysis step expects a file in current directory:
#  RootAnalysis_Weights.root - file with number of primary vertices in MC files used in analysis
#
#processName = Analysis
#

./test htt.ini      #this runs actual analysis and creates plots in fig_png and fig_C directories

#For the step 3) the processName can be any string except PU and Weights, which reserved for step 1)
