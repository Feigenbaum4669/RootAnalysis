#NOTE: File htt.ini files contain paths to the data files. Please update it before running the code.
#Running the analysis requires three steps:
# 1) - making histograms with observed number of primary vertices.
#     Steps 1) and 2) are expectedd to be run only once, when new data files are produced.
#     for this one has to set. Before this please remove old ROOT files:

rm -f RootAnalysis*

#
#processName = PU
#
# in htt.iti

./test htt.ini #this creates histograms with observed PU

# 2) Make the event weights tree. This TTree has lenght equal to sum of lenghts of
# input TTrees, so in particular order of tress in htt.ini is RELEVANT.
#To run this step one has to set
#
#
#processName = Weights
#

./test htt.ini #this creates TTree with PU weights


#  3) The main analysis. This step is expected to be run many times.
#  To run this step one has to set
#
#processName = Analysis
#

./test htt.ini      #this runs actual analysis and creates plots in fig_png and fig_C directories

#For the step 3) the processName can be any string except PU and Weights, which reserved for steps 1) and 2).
